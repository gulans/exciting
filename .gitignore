# .gitignore for exciting
#
# Please familiarise yourself with .gitignore patterns before contributing.
# Also consider whether it is better to add patterns to the root gitignore
# or if a local .gitignore is more appropriate.
#
# Basic patterns
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#   Entry                        Ignores
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#   target/      folder named target (due to the trailing /) recursively
#   target       file or folder named target recursively
#  /target       file or folder named target in the top-most directory (due to the leading /)
#  /target/      folder named target in the top-most directory (leading and trailing /)
#  *.class       every file or folder ending with .class recursively
