    "**`exciting`**, as a code based on plane-wave augmentation, distinguishes between the interstitial and muffin-tin regions. In the interstitial region, various quantities, such as wavefunctions, potential, and density are described by means of plane waves. The quality (completeness) of this basis is determined by the maximum wavevector, defined via either <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">gmaxvr</span></code> or <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">rgkmax</span></code>.  Basis functions in the muffin-tin region are much more cumbersome to define and, thus, require a detailed description. Furthermore, each muffin tin is associated with an atom with a specific nuclear charge, mass, etc. All this information is summarized in species files.\n"

    "To utilize this algorithm, the species file must specify the principal quantum number rather than the linearization energy. For the example given above, the <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">trialEnergy</span></code> = **\"0.1500\"** corresponds to the $2s$ state and therefore needs to be replaced by <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">n</span></code> = **\"2\"**. The lower energy <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">trialEnergy</span></code> = **\"-1.8784\"** corresponds to the $1s$ state and needs to be replaced by <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">n</span></code> = **\"1\"**. The whole local orbital subelement then looks like the following.\n",

    "The standard local orbitals in **`exciting`** are scalar relativistic basis functions. While this is a good approximation for most materials, those with strong spin-orbit coupling (**SOC**) effects are not properly described using a scalar relativistic (**sr**) basis. Therefore, we introduce so called Dirac-type local orbitals.\n",
    "The \"primitive\" functions of these Dirac-type local orbitals are calculated with the radial Dirac equation instead of the Schrödinger equation and, thus, depend on the total angular momentum $j$. To define them, we use the relativistic quantum number $\\kappa$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac-type orbitals can be added to the basis, by including an <code><span style=\"color:green\">lo</span></code> subelement with the attribute <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">kappa</span></code> to the <code><span style=\"color:green\">basis</span></code> subelement as follows.\n",

    "In the above shown code block, we add a $p$-orbital with total angular momentum $j=1/2$ to the basis. This orbital is especially important since it differs strongly from the **sr** $p$-orbital. Unlike the **sr** one, it has a non-zero value at $r=0$ and therefore, cannot be represented in an **sr** basis.\n",
    "Dirac type local orbitals should **always** be used in combination with **second variation with local orbitals** which can be enabled by setting the input parameter [svlo](http://exciting.wikidot.com/ref:groundstate#spin) to **true**."
